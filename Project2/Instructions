CSC401 Fall 2021 
Instructor: Odelia Schwartz 
TA: Alexandros Kahn 
Project 2 
 
September 23, 2021 (due October 22, 2021 by midnight, on Blackboard).  
 
Do an algorithm animation of Randomize-In-Place (we discussed in CSC317 class; see 
pseudocode in CLRS book, Chapter 5, p 126): 
 
RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE(A) 
1. n=A.length 
2. for i = 1 to n 
3.      swap A[i] with A[Random(i,n)] 
 
The algorithm should display the pseudocode and line by line highlighting through the code, 
along with the resulting array. Test your algorithm to see that it works as you expect it to. For an 
example of an algorithm animation (which is different than the above assignment, but shows a 
full example of implementing an animation of another algorithm we learned in class), see 
Partition Algorithm Animation: 
(http://www.cs.miami.edu/~burt/learning/Csc517.101/workbook/partition.html). Feel free to 
modify the style of your animation to your liking. 
 
Submit all your files (e.g., the html files and any auxiliary files), or a link to your website (e.g., 
GitHub), through Blackboard.
